Angular Wrapper
--------------------
(Dont worry, we are searching for a better name for the library)
Basically, this library is a wrapper around angular, using typescript as the main coding language.  
We first started this library to circumvent and later fix or resolve some of the gray areas in angular. Lots of programmers now days come from the web world, and they are already accustomed to dynamic languages and their advantages, but sometimes ignoring the benefits of using strong typing,  and using classical inheritance vs prototypical inheritance. This library is oriented to people who want to have a more classical approach to application development, but still enjoy new technologies like angular, using tools like gulp to compile, run tests and do tons of other stuff.

Regarding angular and its idea of MVW, we are not happy with the W. "Whatever" is not a software philosophy, but a lack of design, a lack of minimal structure, which in the end produces lots of programmer not knowing what is the best place to develop some specific functionality. We aim to fix that while still giving power to the user.
